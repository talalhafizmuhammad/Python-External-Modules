# 📊 Pandas Learning Journey  

This repository contains my hands-on practice and notes while learning **Pandas** for data analysis.  
I explored data cleaning, manipulation, aggregation, and visualization using real-world datasets.  

---

## 🚀 What I Learned  
- ✅ Reading and writing data (`CSV`, `Excel`, `JSON`)  
- ✅ Indexing, filtering, and slicing DataFrames  
- ✅ Handling missing values  
- ✅ GroupBy operations & aggregations  
- ✅ Merging, joining, and concatenating datasets  
- ✅ Sorting and ranking data  
- ✅ Applying custom functions with `apply()` & `lambda`  
- ✅ Data visualization with Pandas (basic plots)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas 📊  
- Jupyter Notebook 📓  

---

## 📌 Next Steps  
- Master **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for advanced visualization  
- Start **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** projects  
- Work on real-world datasets (Kaggle / public datasets)
